# OverTheWire
[OverTheWire](https://overthewire.org) is a community that offers curated wargames to "to learn and practice security concepts in the form of fun-filled games".

This repository is mostly to serve as a quick reference for the things I've learned playing through the wargames.

The games are played in the order suggested on the website—starting with [Bandit](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/)—and each documented in its own directory.
